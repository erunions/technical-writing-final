                    <p>If you’re looking to get started with web development, you’ve probably heard the terms HTML and CSS thrown around. In this post, the fundamentals of HTML and CSS will be explained.</p>
                    <p><b>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</b> is not necessarily a coding language, but more of a markup language as the name implies. What that means is that it already has a set of rules to follow instead of commands for the computer to read. In HTML, the main parts of your website are called elements. Elements are defined by having two triangular brackets enclosing them (< >). The closing tag of the element also must have a slash before the tag to indicate it is a closing tag. Elements on their own won’t do anything, they need something inside of them to display. For example:</p>
                    <img class="imgignore" src="assets/img/htmlcss1.png" style="box-shadow: none;object-fit: contain;width: 50%;height: initial;margin-bottom: 20px;margin-left: 25%;">
                    <p>Just using HTML, you can only go so far. An example of a website with only HTML would look something like this:</p>
                    <img class="imgignore" src="assets/img/htmlcss2.png" style="box-shadow: none;object-fit: contain;width: 50%;height: initial;margin-bottom: 20px;margin-left: 25%;">
                    <p>If you want to have a fancier website, you need to use <b>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</b>. CSS allows you to add attributes to HTML tags, and each tag has different options you can change with CSS. Returning to our example from before, here’s the same website with some CSS added.</p>
                    <img class="imgignore" src="assets/img/htmlcss3.png" style="box-shadow: none;object-fit: contain;width: 50%;height: initial;margin-bottom: 20px;margin-left: 25%;">
                    <p>You’ll notice a lot of formatting has been added, and contrast to highlight the main content. There are many principles of web design, and they all rely on CSS to have a clean and modern website. CSS can add colours, fonts, spacing and more. While HTML uses tags indicated by <>, CSS uses selectors which use the HTML tag and curly brackets {}. In the selector, you specify which parts of the element you want to change, or add formatting with margin and padding.</p>
                    <p>There is much more to explore when it comes to web design, but this should serve as a simple introduction to the 2 main languages websites are created with.</p>
