                    <h1>A Short Explanation of SSL/TLS</h1>
                    <hr>
                    <p>If you‚Äôve been on the internet enough, you‚Äôve probably seen the small lock (üîí) icon in the corner of some websites. This lock indicates that the website is secure, and using the <b>Secure Socket Layer protocol (SSL)</b> or the <b>Transport Layer Security protocol (TLS)</b>. But what is SSL? In short, it‚Äôs a protocol websites can use to hide the data being passed between the user and the website. Basically, the website sends the browser a certificate that the browser looks at and checks if it‚Äôs legitimate. If it verifies the certificate, it sends a go ahead to the server to start a secure SSL session. It sounds like a lot, but it happens incredibly quickly. </p>
                    <img src="assets/img/sslimg1.jpg">
                    <p>This system makes sure hackers can‚Äôt intercept your banking information or see what you‚Äôre up to. SSL has a successor, too. It‚Äôs called TLS and it was released in 1999 as an upgrade to SSL v3.0. The main difference is that TLS‚Äôs handshake (the part where it establishes a secure connection) involves many more steps and moving parts. TLS is very similar to SSL once it establishes a connection, except it‚Äôs harder to gain unauthorized access to. The protocols are so similar most web technicians group them together and refer to both as SSL.</p>
                    <img src="assets/img/sslimg2.jpg">
                    <p>Another thing SSL and TLS do is change the link of the website. When you copy a link to send to someone, it‚Äôll always start with something like this: ‚Äúhttp://‚Äù or ‚Äúhttps://‚Äù. After everything explained here, you can probably guess what the S stands for: secure. That‚Äôs what the lock signifies. An unlocked lock means the website is HTTP, which is unprotected and unsafe. A locked lock means the website is HTTPS, and using a safe protocol such as SSL or TLS.</p>
